# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest

Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of a Random Forest classifier to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. Each transaction is labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset.
The dataset contains the following features:
* Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
* V1 to V28: Result of a PCA transformation of the original features.
* Amount: Transaction amount.
* Class: Target variable (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud).

Requirements
To run the code, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
